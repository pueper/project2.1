Time, it needs time to win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love can bring back your love someday
I will be there, I will be there

Fight, babe, I'll fight to win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love can bring down the wall someday
I will be there, I will be there

If we go again all the way from the start
I would try to change the things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong that I can't get through
Is there really no chance to start once again? I'm loving you

Try, baby, try to trust in my love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, our love just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there, I will be there

If we'd go again, all the way from the start
I would try to change the things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong that I can't get through
Is there really no chance to start once again?

If we'd go again, all the way from the start
I would try to change the things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know what you've been through
You should give me a chance, this can't be the end

I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you

Still loving you, baby

Still loving you
I need your love
Still loving you
I need your love, oh
Still loving you
I need your love, oh
I need your love
I need your love...
